      <description>Abstract: Conventional acid fracturing systems experience challenges during flowback, especially in depleted and gas reservoirs. Additionally, limited acid penetration is observed because of the low fluid efficiency and high reactivity at elevated temperatures. To overcome these challenges, foamed acids have emerged as a promising alternative. This study investigates the potential of seawater-based CO2-foamed acid in enhancing the fracture conductivity under harsh reservoir conditions. Three foamed acid systems were formulated: foamed CO2, CO2 foamed Glutamic diacetic acid (GLDA)-based, and CO2 foamed hydrochloric acid (HCl)-based. A core flooding system was used to perform acid fracturing treatments at 100 °C and 1,200 psi, where the conductivity was measured at different confining pressures. A high-resolution surface analyzer assessed the etching profile and surface roughness. Moreover, the rock strength before and after treatment was measured with a Brinell hardness tester. The viscosity and stability of foamed CO2 were measured via a high-pressure, high-temperature foam flow loop rheometer. The liquid solution consisted of synthetic seawater with a salt mixture totaling 57.707 g/L and a 3 wt % foaming agent. The outcomes of the foam rheometer indicated that the foamed CO2 produced a viscosity of 82 cP at a shear rate of 100/s and a temperature of 100 °C. Fracture conductivity is significantly influenced by surface roughness. Higher roughness presented higher fracture conductivity. …&#10;Topics: Materials science, Composite material, Conductivity, Viscosity, Rheometer&#10;Venue: Energy &amp; Fuels&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: &lt;title&gt;Abstract&lt;/title&gt; This study presents a comprehensive numerical investigation of the geochemical compatibility of a biomass-derived alkaline agent, Date Palm Ash (DPA), for enhanced oil recovery (EOR) applications. The DPA solution (1 wt.%, pH = 11.87) was modelled as a mixed alkaline system containing Ca(OH)₂, NaOH, KOH, and Mg(OH)₂ and equilibrated with carbonate (pH = 5.81) and sandstone (pH = 6.16) formation brines over temperatures of 25–100 °C at 3000 psig using coupled geochemical–reservoir simulation. Results show that in carbonate formations, maximum calcite (613 ppm) and barite (14 ppm) precipitation occurred at a DPA fraction of 0.2, with calcite relatively insensitive to temperature, while barite decreased sharply and disappeared at 100 °C. In sandstone formations, initial calcite concentration was negligible and increased progressively with DPA fraction, reaching its maximum near 0.8 fraction, with no observable barite precipitation. Reservoir simulations further demonstrated higher permeability impairment and calcite adsorption in carbonate reservoirs, leading to lower fractional oil recovery (~0.58) compared to sandstone reservoirs (~0.62). Three-dimensional analyses revealed more pronounced permeability reduction and mineral deposition in carbonate systems, whereas sandstone formations maintained higher productivity indices and lower salinity effects. Overall, DPA exhibited superior geochemical compatibility and flow performance in sandstone reservoirs. …&#10;Topics: Calcite, Carbonate, Compatibility (geochemistry), Enhanced oil recovery, Geology&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract The substantial rise in greenhouse gas emissions, especially carbon dioxide (CO 2 ), is causing global warming, sea level rise, and climate change. This situation has prompted a search for effective and environmentally friendly carbon capture, utilization, and storage (CCUS) methods, which are emerging as significant solutions with the potential to reduce CO 2 emissions on a large scale. However, the current methods of CO 2 capture, which are primarily based on absorption techniques, face significant challenges. This involves limited CO 2 capture capacity, degradation of expensive reagents, thermal instability, and high costs associated with separation and purification during the CO 2 capture process, along with the need for energy input for carbon conversion and utilization. In response to these challenges, the application of ionic liquids (ILs) for CO 2 capture has gained increasing interest among scientists. These ILs are characterized by low vaporization, low flammability, high designability, and non-corrosive properties, which make them a viable alternative to traditional CO 2 capture, conversion, and sequestration processes. Hence, the present review offers a comprehensive overview of the fundamental properties of ILs, as well as examining their role in CO 2 capture and conversion, and their applications in enhanced oil recovery (EOR). It examines how the ILs facilitate CO 2 capture through both physical and chemical absorption mechanisms, and explores the infl…&#10;Topics: Ionic liquid, Greenhouse gas, Carbon dioxide, Carbon capture and storage (timeline), Environmentally friendly&#10;Venue: International Journal of Coal Science &amp; Technology&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Carbon nanodots (CNDs) are promising materials that are gaining widespread use in various applications within the petroleum industry, including enhanced oil recovery, nanofluid applications, corrosion inhibition, lubrication, and environmental remediation. This study proposes an innovative approach to reducing the viscosity and drag of EAS in pipes by incorporating CNDs into the EAS. The results are very promising in terms of reducing the viscosity and drag reduction of EAS, which leads to improved flow efficiency, saves energy, delivers acid deeper into the formation, improves the wormholes, and reduces the operational cost. The objective of this study is to utilize carbon nanodots (CNDs)as drag-reducing agents (DRAs) for the emulsified acid system (EAS) in pipes. CNDs are environmentally friendly and widely available, easy-to-synthesize nanomaterials that possess unique properties and are utilized in various applications across different industries. CNDs are characterized by their biocompatibility and chemical stability, and the CNDs’ sizes are usually less than 10 nanometers. Several experiments have been conducted to investigate the utilization of CNDs as DRAs for the EAS. Firstly, EAS was prepared based on a commercial formulation. Then, the developed EAS was initially tested for conductivity and drop-test to ensure that the continuous phase of the emulsion (outer phase) is diesel. After that, the thermal stability for the range of temperatures and the rheologic…&#10;Topics: Materials science, Nanofluid, Viscosity, Drag, Graphene&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Accurate real-time measurement of pipeline multi-phase flow is crucial for effective reservoir management and production optimization. However, the multi-phase flow measurement is challenging due to the complex flow and fluid distribution. Conventional multi-phase flow meters are complex and expensive and require specific installation, regular calibration, and maintenance. Physical multi-phase flow meters and periodic well testing are widely used as benchmarks; however, phase-rate uncertainty can increase in multi-phase service and is sensitive to operating envelope, flow regime, and calibration/verification practices. The need for an easy and accurate measurement of multi-phase flow is essential, and virtual flow meters (VFMs) can provide a cost-effective, low-maintenance complementary approach to estimating multi-phase flow rates by leveraging machine learning (ML) techniques with available flow data. VFMs are software-based models that utilize mathematical models and readily available sensor data (such as pressure, temperature, and differential pressure) to determine flow rates without the need for physical flow meters. This comprehensive review explores the recent technologies, advancements, and approaches of VFMs. Different types of VFM models and methodologies to develop the VFM model were highlighted with a focus on ML techniques integrated with multi-phase flow characteristics. The challenges, limitations, and future directions of VFM models were also discussed, espec…&#10;Topics: Metering mode, Computer science, Flow (mathematics), Pipeline (software), Machine learning&#10;Venue: Machine Learning with Applications&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Foam-based fluids are commonly used in underbalanced drilling (UBD) to reduce formation damage, enhance cuttings transport, and maintain pressure control in low-density drilling environments. However, their stability can be compromised under high-salinity and alkaline conditions typical of UBD operations. This study presents the formulation and evaluation of a simplified and environmentally friendly foam system based on a green, biodegradable surfactant (GreenSurf) combined with green stabilizers. Foam formulations were evaluated using a Dynamic Foam Analyzer (DFA) under ambient conditions with both air and nitrogen gas phases. A series of tests were conducted to identify the optimal surfactant concentration and screen stabilizer performance and to benchmark the optimized systems against a commercial multicomponent foam blend. Three water-soluble polymers─polyanionic cellulose (PAC), carboxymethyl cellulose sodium salts (CMC), and xanthan gum (XC)─were assessed across different concentrations. Results showed that GreenSurf achieved optimal stability at 1.0 wt %. PAC consistently reduced foam half-life and was excluded from further optimization. CMC at 9 g/L and XC at 6 g/L significantly enhanced foam stability, reaching half-lives of 6473 and 15,969 s, respectively. Both polymer-enhanced systems outperformed the commercial blend in foam stability (5820 s) under the same test conditions. Liquid drainage analysis and structural imaging confirmed improved water retention and bub…&#10;Topics: Pulmonary surfactant, Stabilizer (aeronautics), Underbalanced drilling, Materials science, Enhanced oil recovery&#10;Venue: ACS Omega&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Pollution of freshwater in arid regions poses a critical environmental challenge threatening water sustainability and ecosystem integrity. This study presents a comprehensive assessment of combined pollution and ecological risk from agricultural drainage water (ADW) in the Al-Qatif region, eastern Saudi Arabia. Twenty samples were collected from the agricultural drainage system in the study area and from regions with treated wastewater irrigation and groundwater irrigation. The samples were characterized for chemical and pharmaceutical pollutants using standardized laboratory methods. Then, indices of water quality and pollution, and ecological risk were computed. The study revealed that &amp;gt;90% of the analyzed ADW samples were extremely polluted with higher contamination of nutrients and moderate for trace elements. Three categories of pollutants (nutrients, trace and toxic elements, and pharmaceuticals) were recognized, which posed a risk to the aquatic organisms, with a hazard index exceeding the threshold value (HI&amp;gt;1). Moreover, pharmaceuticals showed a higher risk for algae with HI exceeding 229. The study concluded that samples from regions irrigated by treated wastewater display higher combined pollution and ecological risk than samples from fields with groundwater irrigation. This indicates that the potential sources of nutrients, trace metals, and pharmaceuticals are the treated wastewater irrigation and animal manure used to fertilize agricultural soil.

      <description>Abstract: Hydrogen is emerging as a cornerstone of the global clean energy transition, yet sustainable production pathways remain a major challenge. This review provides a comprehensive and comparative assessment of catalytic and non-catalytic biomass conversion technologies, including pyrolysis, gasification, and supercritical water gasification, for hydrogen-rich syngas production. Unlike previous reviews focused on individual processes, this work uniquely integrates the thermochemical fundamentals, catalytic mechanisms, and reactor configurations that govern hydrogen selectivity. Particular emphasis is placed on the effects of process parameters such as temperature, pressure, residence time, gasifying agents, and catalyst loading on syngas composition and yield. Emerging technologies such as microwave-assisted, plasma-assisted, and hybrid pyrolysis–gasification systems are critically analyzed for their potential to enhance process efficiency and hydrogen purity. Moreover, this review pioneers the discussion of artificial intelligence (AI)-driven modeling and optimization frameworks for predicting and improving biomass-to-hydrogen conversion performance. A techno-economic and life cycle assessment (LCA) perspective is presented, demonstrating that biomass-derived hydrogen can achieve low or even negative carbon emissions with carbon capture and renewable energy integration. By consolidating recent advances and identifying persistent challenges in catalyst stability, reactor scalabili…&#10;Topics: Syngas, Steam reforming, Hydrogen technologies, Hydrogen production, Environmental science&#10;Venue: Biomass Futures&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Efficient removal of hematite-based filter cake is critical for restoring formation permeability while minimizing secondary formation damage. Conventional hydrochloric acid treatments often lead to severe corrosion and iron precipitation when reacting with carbonate formations. In this study, a combined chelating system consisting of 10 wt% diethylenetriaminepentaacetic acid (DTPA) and 10 wt% citric acid was developed to dissolve hematite-based filter cake under formation-friendly conditions. The solution, maintained at a pH of 2.25, achieved a solubility of 3.4 g of hematite per 100 cc of solution after 18 hours at 185 °F. The combination of DTPA and citric acid provided a synergistic chelating capability that stabilized the dissolved iron species, preventing reprecipitation during pH increase caused by calcite dissolution. The inclusion of citric acid significantly reduced the required DTPA concentration—addressing the economic limitation of DTPA&apos;s high cost—while maintaining high iron-chelating efficiency. A systematic series of solubility tests was conducted to evaluate the effects of solution pH, temperature, and treatment time on the dissolution performance. Results showed that solubility increased with temperature and prolonged exposure time, reaching optimal performance after 18 hours. Laboratory-prepared filter cakes formed on ceramic disks exhibited 85% removal efficiency under the optimized conditions. Additionally, corrosion testing revealed substantially…&#10;Topics: Citric acid, Chemistry, Solubility, Filter cake, Dissolution&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study targets lowering the minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) and first-contact miscibility pressure (FCMP) of CO2–oil system to enable miscible/near-miscible CO2 flooding at safer, more practical injection pressures. We evaluate an eco-driven ionic liquid (IL), which is 1-methyl-3-octylimidazolium chloride ([C8mim]Cl), as a low-dosage additive to enhance CO2 miscibility and, in turn, improve oil recovery and CO2 potential storage in carbonate cores. ILs proved their potential to improve CO2 miscibility in crude oil and, due to that, different concentrations (0.25–0.75 wt%) of [C8mim]Cl were screened by vanishing interfacial tension (VIT) at 50 °C to quantify IFT–pressure trends and extract MMP and FCMP with and without [C8mim]Cl. The core flooding procedure used two composite Indiana-limestone plugs representing (a) base case, where secondary seawater injection followed by continuous CO2 injection is attained, (b) IL case, the same sequence but with a 1.5 PV pre-slug of 0.5 wt% [C8mim]Cl in seawater and around thirty hours soak before CO2 injection. VIT screening identified 0.5 wt% as the optimum [C8mim]Cl dose, lowering MMP from 1,642 psi to 1,499 psi and FCMP from 1,976 psi to 1,655 psi. These reductions can be identified in percentages as 8.7% and 16.27%, respectively. In core flooding, the IL pre-slug injected after secondary seawater flooding increased tertiary CO2 recovery from 29.7 % (base) to 39.7 % and raised total recovery from 82 % to 95.2%, correspo…&#10;Topics: Miscibility, Enhanced oil recovery, Seawater, Petroleum engineering, Carbonate&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Carbonate reservoirs, which account for a substantial portion of global hydrocarbon resources, often require acid stimulation to enhance permeability and improve well productivity. Conventional acidizing treatments typically involve the use of hydrochloric acid (HCl) to dissolve carbonate minerals such as calcite and dolomite. However, these treatments frequently encounter challenges including rapid acid-rock reactions in high-temperature reservoirs, inefficient acid utilization, and non-uniform penetration, which reduce the overall effectiveness of the stimulation process. Our study aims to develop an acidizing treatment composed of HCl and thermochemical additives for improved acid placement and acid-rock reaction control. The use of reactive additives leads to improved acid distribution in the formation and reduces early acid spending near the wellbore by reducing the local temperature. To assess the effectiveness of this new approach, laboratory core flood tests were done on carbonate rock samples. The tests showed that permeability improvement was much better than conventional acid systems, thus proving the effectiveness of the treatment enhanced with thermochemical additives. The new treatment gives us a feasible and scalable option to enhance the stimulation treatment in the carbonate reservoirs. The results provide a basis for improving the technique&apos;s design for implementing on the field in difficult reservoir conditions.&#10;Topics: Carbonate, Petroleum engineering, Hydrochloric acid, Permeability (electromagnetism), Environmental science&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Summary Acid fracturing is a widely used stimulation method for carbonate reservoirs, aiming to enhance productivity by creating conductive fractures through mineral dissolution. However, acid-rock interactions can significantly weaken the mechanical integrity of the formation, leading to a rapid closure of fractures and loss of conductivity over time. Preserving the mechanical stability of acidized zones is critical for maintaining long-term well productivity. Chemical consolidation techniques, such as treatment with diammonium phosphate (DAP), are now used as potential solutions. DAP treatment results in the formation of harder mineral phases, including hydroxyapatite (HAP), on carbonate surfaces, restoring stiffness and maintaining fracture conductivity under stress. While successful results have been reported for acidized chalk and limestone, the reactivity of dolostone and other downhole minerals, such as anhydrite, with DAP remains less well understood. Dolomite reacts more reluctantly than calcite with DAP, producing poorly crystalline HAP and magnesium-rich phosphates. At the same time, anhydrite can dissolve under high-temperature DAP treatments, contributing calcium for secondary mineral precipitation. This study investigates the use of DAP to consolidate acidized dolomitic carbonate samples under downhole conditions. Although acidizing successfully etched the rock, it also led to channel formation that prevented measurable pressure drops during conductivity coreflo…&#10;Topics: Dolomite, Calcite, Carbonate, Anhydrite, Mineralogy&#10;Venue: SPE Journal&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: High-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) drilling environments often compromise the stability, rheology, and filtration performance of oil-based drilling fluids (OBDFs). To address these challenges, this study introduces a mineralogically engineered organoclay (OC) blend that harnesses the synergistic interaction between Claytone-II, an anorthite-rich non-swelling mineral, and Claytone-SF, a montmorillonite-dominant swelling clay. Comprehensive characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and particle size distribution (PSD) analyses was performed to evaluate the structural and compositional attributes of the individual and blended OCs. The formulated OBDFs were experimentally assessed for density, electrical stability, rheology, viscoelasticity, sag resistance, and HPHT filtration performance, demonstrating clear rheological enhancement and improved overall stability under extreme downhole conditions. Results show that the 1:1 Claytone-II/Claytone-SF blend significantly enhanced emulsion integrity, increasing electrical stability by 22%, improving plastic viscosity (PV) by 9% and yield point (YP) by 32.5%, and reducing HPHT filtrate volume and filter-cake thickness by 22.5% and 9%, respectively, compared with the average performance of the individual OCs, while the commercial OC (MC-TONE) was used solely as a reference benchmark. These enhancements are interpreted to arise from a synergistic multi-scale colloi…&#10;Topics: Drilling fluid, Materials science, Swelling, Rheology, Filtration (mathematics)&#10;Venue: Petroleum Research&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Hydrogen (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is gaining momentum as a clean energy carrier, yet large-scale storage remains a major challenge. Storing hydrogen in depleted gas reservoirs is a promising option, leveraging existing infrastructure and proven containment reliability. A key factor influencing storage efficiency is the surface tension (ST) at the gas-brine interface, which controls capillary trapping and fluid flow. However, direct ST measurements are costly and time-consuming, motivating the use of predictive tools. This study applies machine learning (ML) algorithms to model ST between hydrogen-methane mixtures and brine under reservoir conditions. A data set of 1050 experimental measurements was used to train and test several ML algorithms. The models include an Adaptive Neuro-Fuzzy Inference System (ANFIS) and artificial neural networks (ANNs) optimized via Bayesian regularization. Model performance was evaluated using the coefficient of determination (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), mean squared error (MSE), and mean absolute percentage error (MAPE). Model-agnostic methods such as partial-dependence plots and permutation feature importance were used for interpretation. All models achieved strong predictive performance (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; &gt; 0.96), significantly better than the ST estimated by empirical correlations. The cascade-forward backpropagation neural network (CFBN) showed the highest training accuracy (&lt;i&gt;R&lt;/i&gt; &lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; = 0.9919, MSE = 0.001, MAPE = 0.334), while the feedfo…&#10;Topics: Mean absolute percentage error, Artificial neural network, Mean squared error, Backpropagation, Computer science&#10;Venue: ACS Omega&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: In high-density water-based drilling fluids, optimizing filtration behavior, filter cake characteristics, and rheological properties is essential for efficient and safe drilling operations. This study investigates the impact of perlite addition on these critical properties using three mud formulations with varying densities. Filtration tests were conducted using filter paper and ceramic disks, while rheological properties were evaluated using industry-standard models. Results revealed that increasing mud density leads to higher filtration volumes and thicker filter cakes, which potentially compromises wellbore stability and increasing the risk of pipe sticking. However, the incorporation of perlite significantly enhanced performance by reducing both filtration volume and filter cake thickness across all densities. Rheological models’ assessments illustrated that the perlite had minimal impact on plastic viscosity (PV) and yield point (YP), but a notable improvement in gel strength behavior, indicating better management of cuttings and entrapped air in drilling operations. Among the tested rheological models, the Herschel-Bulkley models offered the closest fluid behavior to the experimental data without and with the perlite addition. These findings highlight perlite’s potential as a valuable additive for enhancing water-based drilling fluids, enhancing operational efficiency and minimizing drilling complications. This study demonstrates perlite effectiveness as a primary addit…&#10;Topics: Perlite, Filtration (mathematics), Rheology, Drilling fluid, Filter cake&#10;Venue: Journal of Petroleum Exploration and Production Technology&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Choosing a representative element volume (REV) from finite cylindrical $μ$CT scans becomes ambiguous when a key field variable exhibits a slow axial trend, because estimated statistics can change systematically with subvolume size and position rather than converging under simple averaging. A practical workflow is presented to size an REV under such nonstationary conditions by first suppressing axial drift/trend to obtain a residual field suitable for second-order analysis, and then selecting the smallest analysis diameter for which low-wavenumber content stabilizes within a prescribed tolerance. The approach is demonstrated on \textit{Thalassinoides}-bearing rocks, whose branching, connected burrow networks impose heterogeneity on length scales comparable to typical laboratory core diameters, making imaging-based microstructural statistics and downstream digital-rock proxies highly sensitive to the chosen subvolume. From segmented data, a scalar ``burrowsity&apos;&apos; field--capturing burrow-related pore spaces and infills--is defined, and axial detrending (with optional normalization) is applied to mitigate acquisition drift and nonstationary trends. Representativeness is then posed as a diameter-convergence problem on nested inscribed cylinders: the two-point covariance and its isotropic spectral counterpart $\widehat{C}$ are estimated, and the smallest diameter at which the low-wavenumber plateau becomes stable is selected.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This paper addresses a critical industry gap: the absence of a standardized, comprehensive framework for integrating diverse drone-collected data into Digital Oilfield (DOF) infrastructures. A detailed, end-to-end workflow is presented to transform raw data from unmanned aerial vehicles (UAVs) into actionable intelligence across onshore and offshore operations while maintaining alignment with industry standards and cybersecurity requirements. The proposed five-stage workflow covering data acquisition, pre-processing, data management and integration, analytics, and application enablement, combines established industry data standards such as WITSML, PRODML, and OSDU with modern drone technologies, cloud platforms, and advanced analytics. Each stage outlines technical specifications, best practices, and NIST-aligned cybersecurity measures to ensure reliability and data integrity across the enterprise. The framework mitigates integration risk through standardized data mapping and quality assurance, supports real-time fusion of multi-modal sensors (visual, thermal, LiDAR, and gas), and enables advanced DOF applications including predictive integrity, anomaly detection, and environmental compliance (methane LDAR). Key integration challenges ranging from cybersecurity and interoperability to data governance are addressed with best-in-class, standards-aligned solutions, enabling safe, secure, and efficient drone-to-DOF operations.

      <description>Abstract: Abstract This study explores the use of machine learning to predict mechanical properties of subsurface rocks, such as indentation-based Elastic modulus, using input features from X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), and gamma ray measurements. Traditional mechanical testing is costly, time-intensive, and often unfeasible for large datasets. Our goal is to develop a predictive tool that leverages accessible field and laboratory data to estimate geomechanical behavior, enabling real-time formation evaluation during drilling. By integrating in-situ measurements such as gamma ray logs while drilling and surface XRD/XRF analysis from cuttings, this approach supports live monitoring of the drilling process and improves on-site decision making without the need for routine lab-based mechanical testing. The dataset for this study was developed from direct experimental measurements on rock samples obtained during coring operations. All measurements were carried out in the laboratory: gamma ray signals were acquired through core scanning, mineralogical composition was determined using XRD, and elemental content was measured with XRF. Mechanical properties were then quantified through depth-resolved micro-indentation testing, ensuring that both geophysical and geochemical data were consistently tied to the same set of core samples. To evaluate predictive performance, we trained and validated multiple machine learning models, including Random Forest, XGBoost, Gradient Boost…&#10;Topics: Coring, Support vector machine, Drilling, Geology, Data set&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Electromagnetic response is commonly computed in two languages: length-gauge molecular polarizabilities and velocity-gauge (Kubo) conductivities for periodic solids. We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs-transition dipoles and interaction kernels-from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via αfs. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing; interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films); and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end. The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet-RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical f-sum saturation) validate the implementation. Immediate priorities include compact, temperature- and salinity-aware kernels with quantified uncertainties and operando interfacial diagnostics for integration into multiphysics digital …&#10;Topics: Dielectric, Kubo formula, Materials science, Polarizability, Polarization (electrochemistry)&#10;Venue: The Journal of Chemical Physics&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Summary Foam has been widely used to control gas mobility during subsurface oil displacement processes, mitigating challenges such as reservoir heterogeneity, gas channeling, and gravity override. Its applications extend to enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and CO2 storage, where foam improves sweep efficiency and reduces gas leakage. However, the thermodynamic instability of foam necessitates a reliable evaluation of its quality and stability before field deployment. This work introduces a novel multifrequency dielectric technique for characterizing both bulk foam and foam flow in porous media. This study presents the first application of a multifrequency dielectric technique for foam characterization, validated against conventional foam analyzer measurements of quality and stability. In the first part of the study, dielectric properties (permittivity and conductivity) were measured for bulk foams generated with sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) surfactant at two concentrations (0.1 wt% and 0.3 wt%) using deionized water (DW) and seawater (SW). Measurements were performed across a 1-MHz to 3-GHz frequency range using an open-ended coaxial probe connected to a Keysight impedance analyzer, and results were compared with those from a standard foam analyzer. The findings showed that conductivity increased with frequency due to ion polarization, particularly at low to intermediate frequencies. Foams generated with SDS in DW exhibited lower permittivity than bulk water, reflecting the reduce…&#10;Topics: Materials science, Dielectric, Enhanced oil recovery, Porous medium, Conductivity&#10;Venue: SPE Journal&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Summary This study investigates the role of bioturbation in controlling early dolomitization within the Lower Marrat Formation (Toarcian), central Saudi Arabia. Integrated ichnological, petrographic, mineralogical, and geochemical analyses of outcrop samples reveal that dolomitization is preferentially confined to burrow fills and associated halos, contrasting sharply with the predominantly calcitic host matrix. Elemental and isotopic data indicate that burrow networks acted as high-permeability conduits that focused Mg-rich, slightly evaporative, low-temperature fluids, driving early dolomite precipitation. Microbially mediated processes were present but played a secondary role. These results demonstrate how trace-fossil architecture strongly influences fluid flow, dolomite distribution, and reservoir heterogeneity in mud-dominated carbonate systems.&#10;Topics: Dolomitization, Dolomite, Geology, Outcrop, Carbonate&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: High-pressure and high-temperature (HPHT) drilling environments challenge the stability and efficiency of conventional oil-based drilling fluids (OBDFs). This study introduces a novel dual-organoclay (OC) formulation combining Claytone-II and Claytone-IMG 400 at a 1:1 ratio, designed to enhance OBDF performance under HPHT conditions. The selected OCs possess distinct mineralogies: one is rich in anorthite, while the other is dominated by montmorillonite, offering complementary properties. Comprehensive characterization using X-ray diffraction (XRD), X-ray fluorescence (XRF), scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and particle size distribution (PSD) analysis revealed significant structural and compositional differences that underpin the observed synergy. Experimental evaluation showed that the OC mixture outperformed individual OCs and a commercial benchmark (MC-TONE) in critical areas including rheology, filtration, and sag stability. Under 275°F and 500 psi conditions, the dual-OC system improved plastic viscosity by 15.5%, yield point by 33%, and reduced filtrate volume and filter cake thickness by 16.5% and 11.5%, respectively. These enhancements contribute to better cuttings transport, reduced fluid loss, and improved wellbore stability. The approach offers a cost-neutral yet performance-enhancing solution using commercially available OCs. It holds promise for extending OBDF applicability in HPHT wells while supporting safer, more efficient, and environmentally responsible …&#10;Topics: Drilling fluid, Petroleum engineering, Rheology, Materials science, Drilling&#10;Venue: Petroleum&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Transient absorption spectroscopy (TAS) is a well-known technique used to study events that take place upon photoexcitation at short time scales (usually from femtoseconds to nanoseconds and up to milli-seconds) and involve processes such as electron transfer, energy transfer, intersystem crossing, isomerization, proton transfer, exciplex or excimer formation, &lt;i&gt;etc&lt;/i&gt;. These events are fundamental steps for the mechanisms of many chemical processes including organic synthetic reactions, photo-polymerization, photodynamic therapy, and thermally activated delayed fluorescence. In this review we thoroughly discuss and critically analyze how to exploit TAS to derive mechanistic insights in these processes. Moreover, some basic principles that can help in easily elucidating and predicting a transient absorption (TA) spectrum are included with previously reported examples. This paper is aimed at facilitating the application of TAS as a tool for mechanistic studies and to provide an overview of the techniques related to scientists and students with diverse scientific backgrounds.&#10;Topics: Photoexcitation, Intersystem crossing, Ultrafast laser spectroscopy, Transient (computer programming), Nanosecond&#10;Venue: Chemical Society Reviews&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: In dynamic time-division duplexing (TDD) systems, half-duplex access points (APs) scheduled either in uplink (UL) or downlink (DL), simultaneously serve users operating in UL and DL on the same time-frequency resources. This incurs cross-link interference from APs operating in DL to APs in UL, and similarly from users operating in UL to users in DL. In this paper, we develop a scalable method for UL-user-to-DL-user interference (UUI) mitigation in dynamic TDD networks. To this end, we note that the UUI observed at each DL user will be predominantly caused by the UL users in its close vicinity. Hence, we propose to form local clusters of UL users for each DL user, including only the UL users that are expected to cause significant UUI to the DL user. Then, we present a graph-coloring-based pilot reuse algorithm that ensures orthogonal pilots among the UL users within the local clusters of each DL user, while maximizing the pilot reuse (i.e., minimizing the pilot length) for scalability. Further, we introduce beamformed DL pilots to estimate effective DL channels (the physical DL channel multiplied by the DL precoding matrix), which together with estimated user-to-user channels enable the multi-antenna DL users to design combining vectors maximizing their signal-to-interference-and-noise ratios, by taking both desired signal amplification and UUI suppression into consideration. We derive an achievable DL spectral efficiency with our proposed pilot schemes and combining vectors. …&#10;Topics: Precoding, Telecommunications link, Computer science, Overhead (engineering), Interference (communication)&#10;Venue: IEEE Open Journal of Signal Processing&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Summary This study presents an enhanced generative AI workflow for reservoir modelling using Pix2Geomodel.v2, an upgraded Pix2Pix-based architecture designed to predict geological and petrophysical properties under increased facies complexity and reduced data requirements. The workflow incorporates a seven-facies geological description and a streamlined 54-layer stratigraphic grid, enabling more detailed representation of heterogeneity while reducing computational effort. Property model(e.g, porosity, permeabilit, and facies) are exported from a reference reservoir model and transformed into paired 2D images for conditional GAN training. The model learns direct relationships between facies, porosity, permeability and volume of shale through property-to-property translation. Preliminary results show that Pix2Geomodel.v2 successfully captures dominant geological patterns, reproduces meaningful cross-property correlations, and maintains spatial continuity consistent with the reference model, as demonstrated by qualitative outputs and variogram analysis. These findings suggest that the enhanced framework can support data-efficient, high-fidelity reservoir characterization, offering a promising path toward reducing modelling uncertainty and accelerating geomodeling workflows&#10;Topics: Facies, Petrophysics, Workflow, Geology, Reservoir modeling&#10;Year: 2026&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Summary Generative artificial intelligence offers powerful new tools for subsurface characterization, complementing traditional geostatistical methods that often fail to capture complex heterogeneity in carbonate systems. This study applies a Pix2Pix conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) to perform image-to-image (property-to-property) translation across reservoir and pore scales. At the reservoir scale, a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the Groningen Rotliegend field was used to train a U-Net generator with a PatchGAN discriminator over 19 000 iterations. The model achieved high predictive accuracy for facies (PA 0.88; FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96; FWIoU 0.95), and strong cross-property translation performance (facies → Sw: PA 0.98; FWIoU 0.97). Variogram-based validation confirmed geological realism. At the pore scale, the same framework reconstructed fine-scale heterogeneity, connectivity, and multiphase-flow pathways from coarse pore structures, reproducing ground-truth simulations. These findings demonstrate that cGAN-based translation can generalize from siliciclastic to carbonate systems, enabling scalable, data-driven modeling of heterogeneity critical to reservoir management and energy-transition applications such as geothermal, CO2 storage, and water-resource studies.

      <description>Abstract: Detecting subtle anomalies in well log data can significantly enhance subsurface characterization and inform reservoir decision-making. Well logs provide detailed records of rock and fluid properties. However, identifying anomalous patterns in these data remains a persistent challenge due to the complexity of geological systems and limitations in traditional statistical models. Classical anomaly detection approaches, such as Gaussian mixture models (GMMs), tend to oversimplify the intricacies of well log responses and often misinterpret geological heterogeneities as tool noise. This misclassification leads to high false positive rates and unreliable anomaly identification. In this context, generative models, particularly generative adversarial networks (GANs), have shown promise in structured data domains; however, they remain underutilized in geoscience applications. This study aims to benchmark the performance of ensemble GANs (EGANs) against GMMs for anomaly detection in well log data. The proposed EGANs framework aggregates multiple independently trained GANs to enhance model stability and robustness. Anomalies are detected based on discriminator scoring, while performance is evaluated using precision, recall, and F1-score across four key logs: gamma ray, travel time, bulk density, and neutron porosity. The results demonstrate that EGANs consistently outperform GMMs across all logs, achieving higher precision (up to 0.70) and F1-scores (up to 0.79), with statistically sig…&#10;Topics: Anomaly detection, Anomaly (physics), Probabilistic logic, Mixture model, Discriminator&#10;Venue: Applied Computing and Geosciences&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: • The impact of uncertainty in aquifer temperature and salinity is investigated. • Aquifer mineral changes are highly sensitive to uncertainty in aquifer temperature. • Residual and solubility trapping mechanisms are dependent on aquifer temperature. • CO 2 mineralization onset time is controlled by formation temperature. • Salinity highly affects all CO 2 trapping mechanisms except mineral trapping. Saline aquifers offer large storage capacities for carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) geo-sequestration. However, key parameters such as aquifer temperature and brine salinity often remain uncertain, especially in thick formations. These uncertainties can significantly influence the CO 2 reactive transport and trapping. Hence, this study aims to quantify the impact of such uncertainties on CO 2 hydrodynamics and geochemical interactions, utilizing field-scale data of the Sleipner CO 2 storage project, where temperature and salinity are treated as uncertain parameters. A response surface methodology (RSM) was employed to systematically investigate these uncertainties and quantify their impact on CO 2 trapping. To do so, a three-dimensional reactive transport model was constructed to simulate multiphase flow, mineral dissolution and precipitation, and CO 2 trapping mechanisms. The geological model of the Utsira formation was modified to match the plume dynamics. Formation temperatures ranging from 35°C to 41°C and salinities between 0.5 and 2 times that of seawater (33,500 ppm) were tested.

      <description>Abstract: CO2 injection has emerged as a pivotal technique in the petroleum industry, offering a cost-effective option to enhance oil recovery while contributing to improved environmental sustainability. The mass transfer of CO2 into reservoir fluids is the primary mechanism responsible for CO2 solubility trapping and enhancement of oil recovery. The minimum miscibility pressure between CO2 and crude oils controls the performance of any CO2-enhanced oil recovery (EOR) and storage project. This paper investigates the influence of reservoir conditions on the CO2-oil miscibility during CO2 injection in oil reservoirs. To do so, pendant drop tests were conducted, and CO2-oil interfacial tension (IFT) was measured at different pressures and two temperatures. The minimum miscibility pressure (MMP) and first contact miscibility pressure (FCM) between the CO2 and crude oil were estimated from the measured IFT values by applying the vanishing interfacial tension (VIT) technique. The measured MMP was found to increase with reservoir temperature as MMP increased from 1175 psi at T=27°C to 2007 psi at T=70°C. Similarly, the FCM pressure was found to significantly increase with reservoir temperature. This research provides a valuable guide for screening oil reservoirs suitable for EOR and CO2 storage.&#10;Topics: Miscibility, Petroleum engineering, Enhanced oil recovery, Petroleum, Solubility&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Purpose. This study aims to improve mineral identification in porphyry hydrothermal alteration zones, particularly in the challenging terrain of the Gilgit area, by combining remote sensing data with Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Methods. Landsat 8 Collection 2 Level 1 imagery from the United States Geological Survey (USGS) was processed using ENVI 5.3 software. Spectral Angle Mapping (SAM) classification was applied to identify alteration minerals. The dataset was then augmented, normalized, and split into training (75%), validation (15%), and testing (15%) sets. A CNN model incorporating convolutional, pooling, and fully connected layers was developed to perform binary classification of mineral compositions. Findings. Advanced CNN-based remote sensing techniques have demonstrated significant potential in mapping porphyry systems. The CNN model achieved over 90% classification accuracy for minerals like feldspar and chalcocite, based on their spectral properties and dominant color features. This approach is beneficial in challenging terrains like Gilgit, where traditio-nal methods can be difficult and expensive. Originality. This study demonstrates the successful integration of remote sensing data with CNN-based algorithms for accurate mineral classification, providing a novel approach to overcoming the limitations of conventional field-based methods in challenging terrains. Practical implications. The approach provides a practical and efficient solution for remote m…&#10;Topics: Remote sensing, Terrain, Identification (biology), Mineral exploration, Computer science&#10;Venue: Mining of Mineral Deposits&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Geological sequestration of carbon dioxide (CO2) in deep saline aquifers requires an improved control of plume migration and enhanced trapping security. Foamed CO2, generated by dispersing CO2 in an aqueous surfactant solution, offers a viable means to increase the storage effectiveness within geological formations. The foamed technique primarily increases the CO2 viscosity and sweep efficiency, thereby providing uniform displacement and enhancing residual trapping. This review critically examines foamed CO2 dynamics in porous media with direct relevance to geo-sequestration applications. First, we outline the underlying pore-scale physics governing foam generation, propagation, and stability, emphasizing their sensitivity to reservoir storage conditions. Literature reports show that high-salinity brines (&gt;100,000 ppm TDS) can reduce foam half-life by 40–80%, while surfactant adsorption onto reservoir minerals (0.2 to 2.5 mg/g rock) leads to notable chemical loss and increased operational costs. Whereas conventional CO2 injections typically yield trapping efficiencies of 10–25% pore volume, experimental studies in saline-aquifer analogs demonstrate that foamed CO2 can raise trapped CO2 saturations within the swept region to 20–60%, depending on surfactant chemistry, rock type, injection strategy, and reservoir heterogeneity. Key deployment challenges of foamed CO2 technologies include foam instability and surfactant degradation under high-salinity aquifer conditions, economic…&#10;Topics: Enhanced oil recovery, Petroleum engineering, Porous medium, Aquifer, Carbon dioxide&#10;Venue: Energy &amp; Fuels&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Electromagnetic response is commonly computed in two languages: length-gauge molecular polarizabilities and velocity-gauge (Kubo) conductivities for periodic solids. We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs-transition dipoles and interaction kernels-from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via $(α_{\rm fs})$. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing, interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films), and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end. The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet-RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical $(f)$-sum saturation) validate the implementation. Immediate priorities include compact, temperature- and salinity-aware kernels with quantified uncertainties and \emph{operando} interfacial diagnostics for integration into…&#10;Topics: Dielectric, Kubo formula, Materials science, Polarizability, Polarization (electrochemistry)&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

We introduce a compact, gauge-invariant bridge that carries the same microscopic inputs-transition dipoles and interaction kernels-from molecules to crystals and heterogeneous media, with explicit SI prefactors and fine-structure scaling via $(α_{\rm fs})$. The long-wavelength limit is handled through a reduced dielectric matrix that retains local-field mixing, interfaces and 2D layers are treated with sheet boundary conditions (rather than naïve ultrathin films), and length-velocity equivalence is enforced in practice by including the equal-time (diamagnetic/contact) term alongside the paramagnetic current. Finite temperature is addressed on the Matsubara axis with numerically stable real-axis evaluation (complex polarization propagator), preserving unit consistency end-to-end. The framework enables predictive, unit-faithful observables from radio frequency to ultraviolet-RF/microwave heating and penetration depth, dielectric-logging contrast, interfacial optics of thin films and 2D sheets, and adsorption metrics via imaginary-axis polarizabilities. Numerical checks (gauge overlay and optical $(f)$-sum saturation) validate the implementation. Immediate priorities include compact, temperature- and salinity-aware kernels with quantified uncertainties and \emph{operando} interfacial diagnostics for integration into…&#10;Topics: Dielectric, Kubo formula, Materials science, Polarizability, Polarization (electrochemistry)&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Illite plays a critical role in diagenetic processes of sedimentary rocks, influencing geochemical evolution, reservoir quality, and fluid flow pathways. This study experimentally investigated the hydrothermal transformation of kaolinite to illite using sandstones from the Upper Ordovician Quwarah Member of Qasim Formation, northwest Saudi Arabia. Experiments were performed to simulate burial diagenesis involving illitization using three fluid systems: a synthetic solution (0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M MgCl2), natural Red Sea water, and modified Red Sea water (0.2 M KCl and 0.5 M MgCl2 + Red Sea water) at different temperatures (80 °C, 150 °C, 200 °C, 250 °C). Analysis included thin-section petrography, scanning electron microscopy, and X-ray diffraction, whereas the elemental compositions of the experimental solutions were analyzed using ICP-MS and Ion Chromatography. At 80 °C and 150 °C, kaolinite underwent dissolution without significant mineralogical changes. At 200 °C, continued kaolinite disaggregation and dissolution produced smectite and mixed smectite–chlorite/illite layers, indicating early transformation pathways. At 250 °C, fluid chemistry exerted strong control on clay minerals. The synthetic solution formed smectite with minor chlorite and illite; Red Sea water favored well developed smectite; the modified Red Sea water promoted well-developed illite due to increased potassium availability. The experiments show illitization is strongly temperature dependent and primarily…&#10;Venue: Minerals&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The development of molecular oxygen evolution catalysts (OECs) that function efficiently at a low applied potential and can be readily anchored to photoelectrodes is crucial for building bias-free photoelectrochemical (PEC) water-splitting devices. In this work, we designed three robust cobalt-based molecular OECs using distinct organic bifunctional linkers: dipicolyl alanine acid (DPAA), dipicolyl glycine acid (DPGA), and dipicolyl-4-aminobenzoic acid (DABA). These linkers were immobilized onto BiVO4 photoanodes to coordinate Co2+ ions. All modified photoanodes exhibited enhanced PEC activity, with Co-DABA/BiVO4 achieving the highest photocurrent density of 3.45 mA cm–2 at 0.6 VRHE─representing enhancements of 1.66-, 1.63-, and 8.92-fold over Co-DPAA/BiVO4, Co-DPGA/BiVO4, and pristine BiVO4, respectively. At this potential, Co-DABA/BiVO4 also attained a Faradaic efficiency of 91% and a turnover frequency (TOF) of 4.54 s–1. Spectroscopic and photoelectrochemical analyses revealed prolonged hole lifetimes, improved charge separation, and accelerated charge transfer kinetics. The superior performance is attributed to the phenylene group in DABA, which promotes hole transfer and increases the oxidation capability, as supported by DFT calculations. Solid-state simulations confirmed hole localization at Co-DABA, with partial delocalization extending to the BiVO4 surface, indicating strong electronic coupling that promotes hole transfer from BiVO4 to the electrolyte across the Co-D…&#10;Venue: ACS Catalysis&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Foam flooding is a well-known technique for effective conformance control, especially in highly heterogeneous and depleted oil and gas reservoirs. It helps to divert the fluid flow from high-permeability zones into the low-permeability, bypassed, or untapped regions of the reservoir, thereby contributing to improved sweep efficiency and yielding incremental oil recovery. However, foam stability and propagation still pose significant challenges, particularly in harsh and complex reservoirs such as Saudi Arabian carbonate formations. They are typically strongly oil-wet and exhibit a diverse range of porosity, permeability, mineralogy, and pH. This study investigates the effect of the functionalized silica nanoparticles, focusing on their influences, especially the type/degree of surface functionalizations, specifically single (S1 and S2)- and double-functionalized silane nanoparticles (S12) as novel additives for enhancing CO2 foam stability under reservoir-representative conditions. Initially, all three types of silane nanoparticles were successfully synthesized and characterized in detail. Later, static (bulk) foam experiments were conducted using a nonionic surfactant (FS-31) with the addition of S12 at various concentrations (0–2.5 wt/v %) and using CO2 as the foaming gas. The foam stability was evaluated by measuring the half-life (H0) of the generated foams. In this screening, the double-functionalized silanes increased the foam half-life by at least 2–4 times higher than…&#10;Venue: Energy &amp; Fuels&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: This study examines the potential of Saudi red mud for CO₂ sequestration through mineral carbonation and its concurrent hydrogen generation. Two batch experiments were conducted under neutral (deionized water) and acidic (1 wt% HCl) conditions at elevated temperature and pressure. Under neutral conditions, the interaction between CO₂ and red mud led to measurable mineralization, with approximately 8.3% of the injected CO₂ converted into Minerals. In contrast, the acidic system induced extensive mineral dissolution and precipitation, releasing higher concentrations of reactive elements into solution. Increasing the amount of red mud in the reaction to twice that used in the DIW case resulted in approximately twice the amount of CO₂ being mineralized. This indicates a strong relationship between red mud mass and its CO₂ sequestration capacity, highlighting that providing more reactive solid material directly enhances the system’s ability to lock CO₂ into stable carbonate minerals. Gas analysis verified hydrogen generation, along with notable hydrogen sulfide formation, particularly under acidic conditions. Overall, the findings reveal that while red mud can facilitate partial CO₂ mineralization and hydrogen evolution, its reactivity strongly depends on pH, with acid-assisted reactions enhancing mineral mobility rather than stable carbonate formation.&#10;Venue: Scientific Reports&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>

      <description>Abstract: The temperature dependence of most solid-state properties is dominated by lattice vibrations, but metals display notable purely electronic effects at low temperature, such as the linear specific heat and the linear entropy, that were derived by Sommerfeld for the non-interacting electron gas via the low-temperature expansion of Fermi-Dirac integrals. Here we treat temperature as a perturbation within density-functional perturbation theory (DFPT). For finite temperature, we show how self-consistency screens the bare, temperature-induced density change obtained in the non-interacting picture: the inverse transpose of the electronic dielectric operator, that includes Adler-Wiser and a term related to the shift in Fermi level, links the self-consistent density response to the bare thermal density change. This approach is implemented in DFTK, and demonstrated by the computation of the second-order derivative of the free energy, and the first-order derivative of entropy for aluminum. Then, we examine the $T\!\to\!0$ limit. The finite temperature formalism contains divergences, that we cure using the Sommerfeld expansion to analyze metallic systems at 0 K. The electronic free energy is quadratic in $T$ provided the Fermi level is not at a Van Hove singularity of the density of states. If the latter happens, another temperature behavior might appear, depending on the type of Van Hove singularity, that we analyze. Our formulation applies to systems periodic in one, two, or three dimen…&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: The characterization of carbonate subsurface reservoirs, which host significant natural resources such as water and hydrocarbon, is crucial for earth scientists and engineers. Key characterization methods include seismic and downhole sonic techniques. This study explores the relative influence of mineralogy versus pore geometry on acoustic velocity and velocity–porosity relationships in carbonate rocks, which is important for seismic and sonic interpretation in reservoir characterization. A global dataset from ten localities encompassing different carbonate lithologies—including limestones, fabric-preserving (FP) and non-fabric-preserving (NFP) dolostones, and siliceous carbonates—was analyzed using laboratory measurements and Differential Effective Medium (DEM) modeling. Results show that the mineralogy influence decreases with porosity, so it is limited only to tight rocks where dolostones show higher velocity than limestones while siliceous carbonates show the least velocity. As porosity increases, FP dolostones retain higher velocities, whereas NFP dolostones have comparable or lower velocities than limestones, contrary to expectations from mineral elastic properties. This behavior is mainly governed by pore geometry, as supported by petrographic analysis and DEM modeling. Siliceous carbonates display notably lower velocities, which is entirely attributed to smaller pore aspect ratios (about 50% less than in limestones) rather than mineralogical effects.

      <description>Abstract: Seismic phase picking is very often used for microseismic monitoring and subsurface imaging. Traditional manual processing is not feasible for either real-time applications or large arrays. Deep learning-based pickers trained on large earthquake catalogs offer an automated alternative. However, they are typically optimized for high signal-to-noise, long-duration networks and struggle with the challenges presented by microseismic datasets, which are purpose-built for limited time without previously detected seismicity. In this study, we demonstrate how a network-wide earthquake phase picker, the Phase Neural Operator (PhaseNO), can be adapted to microseismic monitoring using transfer learning. Starting from a PhaseNO model pre-trained on more than 57,000 three-component earthquake and noise records, we fine-tune the model using only 200 labeled and noise seismograms from induced events in hydraulic-fracturing settings. The fine-tuned model thus preserves the rich spatio-temporal representation learned from abundant earthquake data, while adapting to the characteristics and labeling conventions of microseismic phases, which are often picked on peaks or troughs rather than onsets. We evaluate performance on three distinct real-world microseismic datasets with different network geometries and acquisition parameters. Compared to the original PhaseNO and a conventional workflow, the adapted model increases F1 score and accuracy by up to 30%, and strongly reduces systematic timing b…&#10;Venue: arXiv (Cornell University)&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

This study introduces Pix2Geomodel, a novel conditional generative adversarial network (cGAN) framework based on the Pix2Pix architecture, designed to predict key reservoir properties (facies, porosity, permeability, and water saturation) from the Rotliegend reservoir of the Groningen gas field. Utilizing a 7.6 million-cell dataset from the Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij, accessed via EPOS-NL, the methodology included data preprocessing, augmentation to generate 2,350 images per property, and training with a U-Net generator and PatchGAN discriminator over 19,000 steps. Evaluation metrics include pixel accuracy (PA), mean intersection over union (mIoU), and frequency-weighted intersection over union (FWIoU). Performance was evaluated in two tasks: (i) masked property prediction and (ii) property-to-property translation. Results demonstrated high accuracy for facies (PA 0.88, FWIoU 0.85) and water saturation (PA 0.96, FWIoU 0.95), with moderate success for porosity (PA 0.70, FWIoU 0.55) and permeability (PA 0.74, FWIoU 0.60), and robust transferability performance (e.g., facies-to-Sw PA 0.98, FWIoU 0.97).

      <description>Abstract: Abstract Barite is a widely used weighting material in water-based drilling muds (WBMs) due to its high specific gravity and cost-effectiveness. However, variations in barite particle size distribution (PSD) can significantly impact drilling fluid performance, influencing properties such as filtration, rheology, and formation damage. This study examines the influence of barite PSD on these key properties and explores the potential of perlite as an additive to enhance drilling fluid performance. To achieve this, three barite grades with distinct PSDs were prepared using sieving and ball milling. These were used to formulate three distinct drilling muds, which were then characterized and tested through laboratory analyses, including particle size analysis, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), x-ray diffraction (XRD), and high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) filtration tests. The methodology aimed to evaluate the effects of PSD variations and perlite addition on filtration behavior, filter cake characteristics, and rheological properties. The results demonstrated that barite PSD significantly affects drilling fluid properties. Smaller barite particles enhanced mud stability and minimized filtration issues, whereas larger particles increased filter cake thickness and permeability, potentially leading to greater formation damage. Notably, the addition of perlite improved rheological stability, reduced filter cake thickness, and optimized overall fluid performance, with the most si…&#10;Venue: Journal of energy resources technology.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Chelating agents have been found to be a promising multifunctional additive in chemical enhanced oil recovery (cEOR), offering unique abilities in altering rock wettability, reducing interfacial tension (IFT), and synergistically enhancing surfactant performance under challenging reservoir conditions. They can sequester multivalent cations and maintain stability in high-temperature, high-salinity environments for both sandstone and carbonate reservoirs. Several chelating agents are reported in the literature, such as EDTA, DTPA, HEDTA, and GLDA, as well as phosphonates like HEDP and NTMP, along with newer biodegradable chelating agents like GLDA. The available literature, which is reviewed, shows that chelating solutions can reduce IFT and alter the wettability of carbonate and sandstone rock surfaces from oil-wet to strongly water-wet, yielding additional oil recoveries of 20–30% of original oil in place under optimized pH, concentration, and different chemical strategies. The synergistic effect of the chelating agent and surfactant further enhances recovery by minimizing surfactant adsorption onto rock surfaces through stable metal-chelant complex formation, thereby preserving surfactant chemical availability in the pore space. Nevertheless, there is still an engaging debate on the extent to which chelating agents can be considered effective and reliable, as their performance is strongly influenced by concentration, mineralogy, pH, and reservoir conditions.

      <description>Abstract: • Predicted acoustic impedance (AI) was generated using multilayer perceptron regression (MLPR), random forest regression (RFR), and extra tree regression (ETR) models compared to AI log and band-limited impedance inversion (BLIMP). • Optimized porosity ( Φ ) and permeability ( K ) derived from the AI data were obtained using empirical exponential rock physics relationships and petrophysical power-law transforms. • Net pay determination based on the condition that the optimized Φ and K values exceed their thresholds. • Net pay masking was applied to identify the productive zone within the hydrocarbon pore volume before computing the original oil in place and performing reserve estimation. • The ETR provided the closest match to the ground truth of the AI log data and all downstream results until the reserve estimation. Reserve estimation in carbonate reservoirs remains challenging because of the nonlinear, power-law relationships among the acoustic impedance (AI), rock physics, and petrophysical properties that govern net pay identification. This study develops a machine learning (ML)-based seismic inversion workflow that integrates multilayer perceptron (MLPR), random forest (RFR), and extra tree regression (ETR) algorithms to predict AI from seismic attributes, depth, and two-way travel time. A limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno with Boundaries (LBFGS-B) optimization minimizes the square errors between reservoir extremes and the threshold values to obtain empir…&#10;Venue: Results in Engineering&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Effective removal of filter cakes is essential for restoring formation permeability and productivity, especially in open-hole completions. While hydrochloric acid (HCl) is commonly used to dissolve filter cakes, it may also introduce secondary formation damage, particularly through iron precipitation and pore plugging during fluid-rock interaction, in addition to the primary damage already caused by mud filtrate invasion and internal filter cake deposition during drilling. This study investigates the relative contributions of primary and secondary damage mechanisms associated with the removal of hematite-water-based filter cake in carbonate reservoirs using 10 wt% HCl under two operational strategies: squeeze and flowback. Core flooding experiments were conducted on Indiana limestone samples under downhole-representative conditions, and formation damage was evaluated through permeability, resistivity, CT imaging, and mechanical property measurements. Results indicated that primary damage alone caused up to 75% permeability reduction, while secondary damage developed during the removal stage, especially in the squeeze treatment where deeper acid invasion promoted iron precipitation in previously undisturbed zones, reducing far-zone permeability and increasing stiffness. In contrast, the flowback scenario improved permeability in the near-wellbore region and minimized secondary damage in the deeper zones, thereby preserving mechanical and petrophysical integrity.

      <description>Abstract: Evaluating the petrophysical properties of carbonate strata with bioturbation necessitates an insight into the heterogeneity in rock texture within burrow fillings. This study examines five separated bioturbated intervals in the upper Hanifa Formation, Saudi Arabia, focusing on burrowing style, depositional texture, diagenetic modifications, porosity, and pore system. The main goal is to understand how the pore system and porosity vary along the vertical profile within the burrow fillings of these bioturbated intervals and how they can be influenced by factors including the burrowing style, the depositional texture, and the diagenetic alterations. Based on the burrowing style, the five bioturbated intervals are categorized into intervals with bio-retextured fabric and intervals with pipe framework burrows, as determined by the results of field studies, petrographic analysis, and medical CT scanning. Data from petrographic investigation revealed that burrow fillings in intervals with a pipe framework burrowing style (intervals 1, 4, and 5) likely deposited in similar environments exhibit minor variations in grain size, with mean grain sizes of 766 ± 752 μm for interval 1, 739 ± 433 μm for interval 4, and 514 ± 341 μm for interval 5. Porosity values from micro-CT scans show 7.15 %, 4 %, and 7.75 %, respectively. In contrast, bio-retextured intervals (intervals 2 and 3) have smaller mean grain sizes of 355 ± 206 and 402 ± 148 μm, with lower total porosity values of 1.64 % and 2.…&#10;Venue: International Journal of Sediment Research&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 0</description>

      <description>Abstract: Wettability is a key factor influencing fluid distribution and storage efficiency in subsurface reservoirs. Understanding how water salinity affects the wettability of carbonate rocks is critical for predicting multiphase flow and optimizing gas storage capacity. The contact angle technique is a standard approach for assessing wettability, but it suffers from significant limitations. Its sensitivity to surface imperfections and contamination, along with its localized nature, often leads to results that do not accurately represent reservoir-scale behavior. Additionally, it overlooks the bulk characteristics of the porous medium. This study instead recommends capillary pressure curve analysis as a more robust and representative method for evaluating wettability under realistic reservoir conditions. This work investigates the impact of salinity—specifically deionized water (DI) and seawater (SW)—on the capillary pressure behavior of pure calcite Indiana limestone samples, assessed through capillary pressure curve measurements to evaluate wettability alteration. According to the literature, Zeta potential of DI with calcite is exhibit a highly negative charge (–22 mV), while Zeta is significantly reduced (–3.25 mV) in SW due to the suppression of surface deprotonation and competitive adsorption of multivalent cations. In addition, capillary pressure curve experiments using nitrogen gas as the non-wetting phase were conducted in three stages: four rock core samples were sequential…&#10;Venue: Earth energy science.&#10;Year: 2025&#10;Citations: 1</description>
