[![DOI](https://zenodo.org/badge/DOI/10.5281/zenodo.18027324.svg)](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.18027324) [![License](https://img.shields.io/github/license/digitalgeosciences/idb)](LICENSE) [![Release](https://img.shields.io/github/v/release/digitalgeosciences/idb)](https://github.com/digitalgeosciences/idb/releases)

The Integrative Dashboard (IDB) is an offline, data-driven research analytics app built with React, Vite, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, and the shadcn/ui component system. It uses locally cached OpenAlex data to keep navigation fast and available without live API calls.

### What you can do
- Explore publications and citations by topic, institution, and member across years.
- Inspect co-author networks and follow out to publication DOIs/URLs.
- Filter instantly with precomputed tables (no waiting on remote queries).

## Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+ (Node 20 recommended)
- npm (bundled with Node.js)

Check your versions:
```bash
node -v
npm -v
```

## Setup
1) Clone the repository and enter it:
```bash
git clone <repo-url> idb-template
cd idb-template
```
2) Install dependencies:
```bash
npm install
```

## Run the app (development)
Start the dev server with hot reload:
```bash
npm run dev
```
Vite will print the local URL (default `http://localhost:8080`).

## Build for production
Create an optimized static build:
```bash
npm run build
```

## Insight rules (Topic Insights)
- Emerging: appears only in Period B.
- Declining: missing in Period B or publications and citations both drop more than 20%.
- Strong surge: publications at least 2x and citations at least 2x.
- Growing priority: publications at least 1.5x and citations at least 1.2x.
- Impact-led: citations at least 1.5x while publications are flat or declining.
- Output rising, impact softening: publications at least 1.2x but citations below 0.9x.
- Stable: none of the above apply.
Preview the production build locally:
```bash
npm run preview
```

## Data and refresh workflow (overview)
- Source authors live in `data/config/authors-source.csv`.
- Node scripts cache works per author and generate CSVs for works, topics, institutions, and member metrics.
- During the build step, those CSVs become generated TypeScript tables that the app loads at runtime.

## Institution filter config
Institution dropdowns are driven by `data/config/institution-filters.json`.

How to add a new option:
1. Open `data/config/institution-filters.json`.
2. Add a new object under `options` with:
- `id`: unique key (used in UI state).
- `label`: full display name.
- `shortLabel`: optional shorter text for the dropdown.
- `match`: `any` or `all`.
- `institutions`: optional direct list of institution names.
- `institutionGroups`: optional list of groups (each group is a list of institution-name variants).
3. If needed, set `default` to the new `id`.

Example option:
```json
{
  "id": "kfupm-saudi-aramco",
  "label": "KFUPM and Saudi Aramco",
  "shortLabel": "KFUPM + Saudi Aramco",
  "match": "all",
  "institutionGroups": [
    ["King Fahd University of Petroleum and Minerals"],
    ["Saudi Aramco (Saudi Arabia)", "Saudi Aramco (United States)"]
  ]
}
```

Matching behavior:
- Matching is case-insensitive on full institution names.
- `match: "any"` includes a publication if at least one configured institution/group matches.
- `match: "all"` includes a publication only if all configured requirements match.
- `institutionGroups` are used for name variants; one hit inside a group satisfies that group.
- For co-affiliation filters (example: KFUPM and Saudi Aramco), use `match: "all"` with separate groups.
- `id: "all"` with an empty configuration means no institution filtering.

Refresh everything with one command:
```bash
npm run refresh:data
```
This runs, in order: `npm run update:authors:openalex`, `npm run generate:authors`, `npm run clean:author-cache`, `npm run cache:openalex-works`, `npm run generate:works`.

## Project structure (high level)
- `src/` - React application source
  - `src/pages/` - top-level pages (dashboard, authors, topics, institutions, publications, about)
  - `src/components/` - reusable UI and layout
- `data/` - configuration and input CSV (author list in `data/config/authors-source.csv`)
- `scripts/` - Node scripts for downloading, caching, and transforming bibliographic data
- `public/` - static assets copied into the final build

## Useful npm scripts
- `npm run dev` - start the development server
- `npm run build` - create a production build in `dist`
- `npm run preview` - preview the production build locally
- `npm run lint` - run eslint
- `npm run refresh:data` - regenerate all derived data tables from source CSV and cached works

## Documentation
- See [docs/README.md](https://github.com/digitalgeosciences/idb/tree/main/docs) for config schemas (authors-source, siteinfo, announcement, blacklist), blacklisting examples, full data refresh details, deployment notes (GitHub Pages/static), and troubleshooting.
